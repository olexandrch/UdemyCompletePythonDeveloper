#1. Wrap the above code in a function called checkDriverAge(). Whenever you call this function, you will get prompted for age. 
# Notice the benefit in having checkDriverAge() instead of copying and pasting the function everytime?

#2 Instead of using the input(). Now, make the checkDriverAge() function accept an argument of age, so that if you enter:
#checkDriverAge(92);
#it returns "Powering On. Enjoy the ride!"
#also make it so that the default age is set to 0 if no argument is given.
